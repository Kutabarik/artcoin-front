        A peer-to-peer marketplace is an online platform that connects (i)
        people who want to sell/rent any kind of product or service and, (ii)
        people who need that product or service. ArtCoin is created to
        facilitate the embracing of sharing economy principles for peers from
        Creative Industry. Our technology and p2p marketplace allows
        individuals, companies and institutions from Creative Industry to
        sell/buy/rent/exchange services/products, while our platform gets a
        static fee from each transaction.
